## Cancer: A Disease of the Genome

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Key characteristics:**

- **Abnormal cell growth** - uncontrolled proliferation
- **Invasive potential** - ability to spread (metastasis)
- Initiated by **acquired genomic mutations** affecting cell growth regulators
- Mutations occur **stochastically**, but rate influenced by environment
- **Clonal evolution** - natural selection of malignant cells

:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Driver vs Passenger Mutations
Cancer genomes typically harbor **2-8 driver mutations** (Vogelstein et al., 2013), though this varies by cancer type. Pediatric cancers often have fewer drivers, while hypermutated adult cancers may have more. Drivers represent a small minority of total mutations.
:::

---

## Hereditary vs Sporadic Cancer

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

### Sporadic (~90-95%)
- Acquired somatic mutations
- Accumulate during lifetime
- Environmental factors contribute

### Hereditary (~5-10%)
- Inherited predisposition alleles
- **BRCA1/2** (breast, ovarian)
- **Lynch syndrome** genes (colorectal)
- Still require somatic "second hits"

## The Hallmarks of Cancer

**8 Core Hallmarks:**

| Hallmark | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Sustaining proliferative signaling | Self-sufficiency in growth signals |
| Evading growth suppressors | Insensitivity to anti-growth signals |
| Resisting cell death | Evading apoptosis |
| Enabling replicative immortality | Limitless replicative potential |
| Inducing angiogenesis | Sustained blood vessel formation |
| Activating invasion & metastasis | Tissue invasion and spread |
| Avoiding immune destruction | Escaping immune surveillance |
| Deregulating cellular energetics | Altered metabolism (Warburg effect) |

**2 Enabling Characteristics:** Genome instability & mutation; Tumor-promoting inflammation

## Variant Terminology: Essential Definitions

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}

**Variant**: A difference in DNA sequence compared to a reference

**Mutation**: The *process* of change in DNA

**Somatic variant**: Occurs only in specific cells/tissues
  - Not inherited
  - Arises during lifetime

**Germline variant**: Present in all cells
  - Can be passed to offspring
  - Present from conception

**Polymorphism**: Traditionally defined as variant >1% frequency in population (though "variant" is now preferred terminology)

:::

:::
::::

---

## Mutation vs Variant: A Practical Example

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

**The Yellow Flower Example:**

- **Mutation**: The change in DNA that caused petals to turn yellow
- **Variant**: The resulting DNA difference between yellow and white flowers

This is a **somatic mutation** - occurring during the plant's development in one branch, analogous to somatic mutations in cancer.

The CCD4a gene mutation prevents breakdown of carotenoids, leading to yellow pigmentation.

## Types of Mutations in Cancer

### Small-scale mutations
- **SNVs** (Single Nucleotide Variants)
- **INDELs** (Insertions and Deletions)

### Structural variations
- **Large INDELs** (>50bp)
- **Translocations** - chromosomal rearrangements
- **Inversions** - reversed DNA segments
- **Fusion transcripts** - gene fusions from translocations
- **CNV** (Copy Number Variation) - gains/losses of genomic regions

**LOH** (Loss of Heterozygosity) is a *consequence* of CNV or copy-neutral events, not a mutation type itself.

::: {.callout-important}
## Clinical Relevance
Different mutation types require different detection methods and have distinct clinical implications for treatment selection.
:::

---

## Mutational Signatures: Fingerprints of Mutagenesis

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Each mutational process leaves a characteristic pattern:

**Signature 1**: Aging (C>T at CpG)

**Signature 4**: Tobacco smoking (C>A)

**Signature 7**: UV light (C>T at dipyrimidines)

**Signature 6**: Mismatch repair deficiency

**Clinical applications:**

- Understanding tumor etiology
- Treatment selection (e.g., PARP inhibitors for HRD)
- Immunotherapy response prediction

## Sequencing Strategies for Cancer Genomics

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

### Coverage strategies
- **Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)**
  - Complete genome coverage
  - Detects all variant types
  - Best for structural variants

- **Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) (Bait Capture)**
  - Protein-coding regions only
  - Cost-effective (<br>WES 100x: 25 M 2 x 100 bp<br>WGS 30x: 450 M 2 x 100 bp<br>)
  - Misses non-coding regions

- **Custom panels (Bait Capture, mostly)**
  - Targeted cancer genes
  - Deep coverage

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Sequencing technologies

**Short reads (2x150bp standard):**

- Illumina, MGI, Element, Ultima
- High accuracy, mature pipelines

**Long reads:**

- PacBio HiFi: >Q30 accuracy
- Oxford Nanopore: Q20+ with R10.4.1
- Superior for SVs and phasing

![Sequencing cost vs throughput, credit: Geert van Gest](../assets/presentations/slidedeck_2/06_sequencing.png){fig-alt="Sequencing technologies"}

:::
::::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Depth Recommendations
WGS: 60-100x tumor, 30-40x normal
WES: 100-200x
ctDNA: 10,000-30,000x
:::

---

## Experimental Design: Tumor-Normal Pairs

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

**The challenge:**
Tumor tissue is heterogeneous - contains:
- Tumor cells
- Immune infiltrates
- Stromal cells
- Normal tissue

**Solution: Paired samples**

1. **Tumor sample** - from the malignancy
2. **Normal sample** - typically blood

**For hematological malignancies**, use skin biopsy or buccal swab (blood IS the tumor!)

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![IGV normal matched vs tumor](../assets/presentations/slidedeck_2/07_CELA1.png){fig-alt="IGV showing tumor vs normal comparison"}

:::
::::

::: {.callout-note}
## Tumor Purity
Typical tumor purity ranges from 30-80%. 
**Samples below 20-30% purity may have insufficient power for reliable somatic variant detection.** Consider pathologist review or microdissection.

## The SAM/BAM/CRAM File Formats

**Purpose:** Store sequence alignments

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

**Key points:**

- **SAM**: Text-based (Human readable)
- **BAM**: **Lossless** binary compressed SAM
  - *Indexable (Fast random access)*
- **CRAM**: **Ref-based** compression
  - *Lossless or Lossy modes*
  - ~30-60% smaller than BAM
  - Requires access to the reference genome for decoding

## Marking PCR Duplicates

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}

**Why it matters:**

- Variant callers assume each read is an **independent observation**
- PCR/optical duplicates violate this assumption
- Can lead to **false positive** variant calls

**Solution:**

- Mark duplicates based on alignment coordinates
- Use **Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs)** for accurate deduplication - especially important for low-input and ctDNA samples

**Tool:** `gatk MarkDuplicates`

:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
![Mark duplicates, [Source](https://nonacus.com/blog-unique-molecular-identifiers-unmask-low-frequency-variants/)](../assets/presentations/slidedeck_2/10_mark_duplicates.jpg){fig-alt="Diagram showing PCR duplicate reads"}

:::
::::

---

## Read Groups: Organizing Your Data

**Purpose:** Track metadata for groups of reads within BAM files

```
@RG ID:rg1 LB:lib1 SM:sampleA PL:ILLUMINA PU:flowcell1.lane1
@RG ID:rg2 LB:lib2 SM:sampleA PL:ILLUMINA PU:flowcell1.lane2

read1  456345 chr20 ... RG:Z:rg1
read2  456348 chr20 ... RG:Z:rg2
```

**Why read groups matter:**

- **BQSR** models are built per-read-group
- **Merging Lanes** Allows combining multiple lanes into one patient file (SM)
- **Duplicate marking** identifies duplicates within same library
- Essential for **QC and troubleshooting**
- Required for **multi-sample variant calling**

::: {.callout-note}
## Best Practice
Add read groups during alignment (`bwa mem -R`) rather than post-hoc (GATK AddOrReplaceReadGroups), for efficiency.
:::

---

## Somatic Variant Calling Challenges
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
**Germline calling assumes:**

- Heterozygous: ~50% VAF (typically 30-70% due to technical variation)
- Homozygous: ~100% VAF

**These assumptions fail in tumors:**

- Variable tumor purity (30-80%, which is effectively contamination by normal cells)
- Clonal heterogeneity (subclones)
- Copy number alterations
- **VAF can be anywhere from <1% to 100%**

**Additional challenges:**

- Sequencing errors, alignment artifacts
- FFPE artifacts 
  - C>T/G>A deamination
  - 8-oxoG which causes the G>T transversions
- Sample contamination

<br>
![VAF distribution comparison](../assets/presentations/slidedeck_2/11_plot_VAF_distributions.png){fig-alt="VAF distribution comparison" position="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
#### Let's make an example (assuming **diploid genome** and CN=2)
**1. The Ideal Case**<br>
**Sample is 100% Tumor**

If a mutation is heterozygous (1 of 2 alleles):
$$\text{VAF} = \frac{1}{2} = \mathbf{50\%}$$

*To a caller, this looks like a clear, standard germline variant.*

**2. The Real World**<br>
**Sample is 40% Tumor** (60% Normal)

The normal cells (wild type) dilute the signal.
$$\text{VAF} = \frac{\text{Purity}}{2}$$
$$\text{VAF} = \frac{0.40}{2} = \mathbf{20\%}$$

:::
::::

## Tumor Purity, Ploidy, and Clonality

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Key concepts:**

**Tumor purity**: Fraction of tumor cells in sample

**Ploidy**: Average copy number across genome (often >2 in cancer)

**Clonal variants**: Present in all tumor cells

**Subclonal variants**: Present in a subset of tumor cells

**VAF interpretation examples:**

- Pure tumor (100%), clonal het variant → VAF ≈ 50%
- 50% purity, clonal het variant → VAF ≈ 25%
- 50% purity, subclonal variant (20% of cells) → VAF ≈ 5%

## Variant Filtering Strategies

**Three key considerations:**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

### 1. Sequencing Error
- Base quality scores (Phred: Q30 = 1/1000 error)
- Variant allele frequency
- Strand bias
- Mapping quality (ie MAPQ ≥ 20)

### 2. Technical Artifacts
- **Panel of Normals (PoN)**: Database of artifacts seen in normal samples
- Systematic errors from library prep or sequencing
- FFPE artifacts

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

### 3. Germline Filtering
- Compare with matched normal
- Filter using population databases:
  - **gnomAD v4.0** (>800K individuals)
  - 1000 Genomes Phase 3 (~2,500 individuals)
- Common variants (AF > 0.1%) are typically germline

:::
::::

::: {.callout-tip}
## gnomAD
The Genome Aggregation Database contains variant frequencies essential for filtering common germline variants.
Most callers (Mutect2, Strelka2) apply these filters automatically, but understanding the logic helps with troubleshooting false positives.
:::

    class D,E resource
    class C,F,G,H,J process
```

**Key features:**

- Haplotype-aware variant calling (local assembly)
- Joint analysis of tumor-normal pairs
- Integrated contamination estimation
- F1R2 (Forward 1st, Reverse 2nd) artifact filtering

::: {.callout-important}
## PoN vs gnomAD
- **Germline Resource**: Filters biological germline variants (universal)
- **PoN**: Filters technical artifacts (platform-specific)

Public PoNs exist but work best when your sequencing 
protocol matches theirs. When in doubt, build your own!

## The VCF File Format

**Variant Call Format**
Standard for storing variant data (current: v4.3)

```vcf
##fileformat=VCFv4.3
##INFO=<ID=DP,Number=1,Type=Integer,Description="Total Depth">
##INFO=<ID=AF,Number=A,Type=Float,Description="Allele Frequency">
##FILTER=<ID=weak_evidence,Description="Insufficient support">
##FILTER=<ID=germline,Description="Likely germline variant">
##FORMAT=<ID=GT,Number=1,Type=String,Description="Genotype">
##FORMAT=<ID=AD,Number=R,Type=Integer,Description="Allelic depths (REF,ALT)">
##FORMAT=<ID=AF,Number=A,Type=Float,Description="Allele Frequency">
#CHROM  POS     ID        REF  ALT  QUAL  FILTER  INFO        FORMAT      TUMOR       NORMAL
chr17   7577538 rs123     G    A    .     PASS    DP=100      GT:AD:AF    0/1:70,30:0.30  0/0:50,0:0.0
chr17   7578406 .         C    T    .     germline DP=85     GT:AD:AF    0/1:40,45:0.53  0/1:30,25:0.45
```

**Key columns explained:**

- **CHROM/POS**: Genomic location
- **REF/ALT**: Reference and alternate alleles  
- **FILTER**: Quality filters applied (PASS = passed all)
- **FORMAT**: Defines sample-specific fields
- **GT**: Genotype (0/0=hom ref, 0/1=het, 1/1=hom alt)
- **AD**: Allele depths (REF count, ALT count)
- **AF**: Variant Allele Frequency = ALT/(REF+ALT)

**Example interpretation:**

Row 1: Somatic mutation (30% VAF in tumor, 0% in normal) ✓  
Row 2: Germline variant (present in both tumor and normal) ✗

::: {.callout-important}
## FILTER Field
"PASS" means the variant passed all filters, **not** that it's biologically validated. Clinical decisions require orthogonal validation (Sanger, ddPCR, amplicon-seq).
:::

## Variant Annotation: The Critical Step

After calling, variants need biological context:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

### Functional Annotation
- **VEP** (Ensembl) or **SnpEff**
- Effect prediction: missense, nonsense, splice site
- Impact assessment: SIFT, PolyPhen, CADD scores

### Clinical Databases
- **ClinVar**: Clinical significance
- **COSMIC**: Cancer mutation database
- **OncoKB**, **CIViC**: Actionability
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Population Frequencies
- gnomAD, dbSNP
- Filter common germline variants

**Detection approach:**

1. Calculate coverage in bins
2. Normalize for GC content and mappability
3. Compare tumor vs normal ratio
4. Segment and call CNV regions

**Tools:** CNVkit, ASCAT, Control-FREEC, PURPLE

## Gene Fusions in Cancer

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Mechanism:**

- Chromosomal translocation
- Fusion of gene elements
- Creates chimeric transcripts

**Detection data types:**

- WGS (genomic breakpoints)
- WES (if breakpoints in exons)
- RNA-seq (fusion transcripts)

**Detection method:**
Discordant alignments where paired reads map to different genes/chromosomes

**Tools:** Manta (DNA), STAR-Fusion, Arriba (RNA-seq)

## Famous Example
BCR-ABL fusion in CML(Chronic Myeloid Leukemia) 

- discovered 1960
- translocation identified 1973
- imatinib approved 2001. 

From observation to targeted therapy took 41 years; 
today we can do this computationally.

## Quality Control Metrics

**Essential QC checks at each stage:**

| Metric | Expected Value | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Mapping rate | >95% | Low = contamination or poor quality |
| Duplicate rate | <30% (WGS) | High = low library complexity |
| Mean coverage | As specified | Low = insufficient data |
| Coverage uniformity | CV <0.2 | High variability = capture issues |
| Contamination | <1-2% | High = sample swap or cross-contamination |
| Ti/Tv ratio | ~2.0-2.1 (WGS), ~3.0-3.3 (exome) | Low = sequencing errors enriched |
| Insert size | 200-400bp (Illumina) | Bimodal = library issues |
| GC bias | Flat across 30-70% GC | Strong bias = PCR or coverage issues |

**Tools:** fastQC, MultiQC, mosdepth, GATK CollectHsMetrics

::: {.callout-important}
## Common Pitfall
Always check for cross-sample contamination - rampant in shared facilities and has caused retractions!
