## Exercises 

### First login

If you are participating in this course with a teacher, you have received a link and a password. Copy-paste the link (including the port, e.g.: `http://12.345.678.91:10002`) in your browser. This should result in the following page:

::: {.callout-note}
The link gives you access to a web version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). This is a powerful code editor that you can also use as a local application on your computer.

Type in the password that was provided to you by the teacher. Now let's open the terminal. You can do that with ++ctrl+grave++. Or by clicking **Application menu** > **Terminal** > **New Terminal**:

For a.o. efficiency and reproducibility it makes sense to execute your commands from a script. With use of the 'new file' button:

### Setup

We will start the exercises with pre-aligned bam files. To start, download and extract the course_data folder:

```sh
wget linkk
gunzip course_data.tar.gz
```

### Quality control of the bam files

First we use the information in the header to get information about the contents of the bam file and how it was generated. 

::: {.callout-important}
## Exercise

Check out the contents of the bam header with `samtools view -H`, and answer the following questions:

a. How is the bam file sorted?
b. Which chromosomes were used as reference?
c. How many read groups are in there, what is the readgroup ID and what is the sample name? 
d. Which aligner was used? 
e. If there are duplicates in there, how are they marked?
f. Which other programs were run to create the bam file? 

::: 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer

To get information on the bam header we run 

```sh
samtools view -H normal.recal.bam
```

Which returns:

```
@HD     VN:1.6  SO:coordinate

@PG     ID:samtools.2   PN:samtools     PP:samtools.1   VN:1.21 CL:samtools view -H tumor.recal.bam
```

a. From the `@HD` tag, we can see that the bam file is sorted by coordinate.
b. We have two lines starting with `@SQ`, which gives us information about the reference used. The reference genome used contains chromosomes 6 and 17.
c. We have one line starting with `@RG`. Specifying there is a read group with ID `HWI-ST466.C1TD1ACXX.normal` and sample name (`SM`) `normal`. 
d. In order to know which programs were run to generate this bam file, we can use the `@PG` tags. Here, we see that the aligner used was `bwa mem` 
e. The duplicates were marked with `MarkDuplicates`. 
f. To sort and compress `samtools sort` and `samtools view` were used. For base quality score recalibration (BQSR) `GATK ApplyBQSR` was used. 

:::

Now we extract information from the alignments themselves. We first have a look at few alignments and then get a summary of the alignments with `samtools flagstat`. 

::: {.callout-important}
## Exercise

Check out the first few alignments with `samtools view`  and `head`. 

a. What is likely the read length used? 
b. Are the reads single-end or paired-end? 
c. Are the first reads tagged with the readgroup ID?

::: 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer

The command:

```sh
samtools view normal.recal.bam | head -3
```

Returns the first three alignments:

```

```

a. At the CIGAR strings we see `100M` and `2S98M`, meaning that the original read had 100 base pairs. So it's likely a read length of 100 bp has been used. 
b. This question might be a bit more challenging. In the 5th column we see an equal sign (`=`). This shows that the mate is mapped to same chromsome, so suggesting we are working with paired-end reads. Secondly, at the `@PG` header tag, we saw that `bwa mem` took two fastq files (`normal_R1.fastq.gz` and `normal_R2.fastq.gz`) as input. Lastly, we can use the sam flags in the second column to figure that out. If you paste the first flag, `163`, in the [explain sam flags website](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html), we can see that the read is paired.
c. Yes, the read group tag starts with `RG`, and is specified for all three alignments. 
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## Exercise

Use `samtools flagstat` to summarize the alignments in both bam files. How many reads are in the bam files? And how many alignments are marked as duplicate? 

::: 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer

```sh 
cd ~/project/data/alignments

for sample in tumor normal
do
    samtools flagstat "$sample".recal.bam > "$sample".recal.bam.flagstat
done
```

returns for `normal.recal.bam`:

```
12744793 + 0 in total (QC-passed reads + QC-failed reads)
12733034 + 0 primary
0 + 0 secondary
11759 + 0 supplementary
1397598 + 0 duplicates
1397598 + 0 primary duplicates
12671529 + 0 mapped (99.43% : N/A)
12659770 + 0 primary mapped (99.42% : N/A)
12733034 + 0 paired in sequencing
6366517 + 0 read1
6366517 + 0 read2
12515974 + 0 properly paired (98.30% : N/A)
12586532 + 0 with itself and mate mapped
73238 + 0 singletons (0.58% : N/A)
20414 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr
13194 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr (mapQ>=5)
```

Showing us that we have 12,744,793 reads, and all those were paired. Of the alignments, 1,397,598 were marked as duplicate. If we do the same for the tumor bam file we see that it has 16,674,562 reads and 1,871,521 alignment marked as duplicate. 

:::

So, all looks good until now. We have many reads and high alignment rates. The bam files seem to be ready for variant analysis, because they have read groups, duplicates are marked and they are sorted by coordinate. However, since we are working with whole exome sequencing (WES) data, we would like to know whether the reads align to the target regions and what kind of coverage we have. For this, we use `gatk CollectHsMetrics`. 

::: {.callout-important}
## Exercise

Create a script called `02_gatk_collecthsmetrics.sh` in `~/project/scripts` to run `gatk CollectHsMetrics` on the two bam files. Here's an example:

```sh
ALIGNDIR=~/project/results/alignments
REFDIR=~/project/data/reference
RESOURCEDIR=~/project/data/resources

for sample in tumor normal
do
    gatk CollectHsMetrics \
    -I "$ALIGNDIR"/"$sample".recal.bam \
    -O "$ALIGNDIR"/"$sample".recal.bam_hs_metrics.txt \
    -R "$REFDIR"/ref_genome.fa \
    --BAIT_INTERVALS "$REFDIR"/exome_regions.bed.interval_list \
    --TARGET_INTERVALS "$REFDIR"/exome_regions.bed.interval_list
done 
```
The produced reports are not so easy to read. To parse the metrics file, we run `multiqc` on the directory:

```sh 
cd ~/project/results/alignments
multiqc .
```

Download the multiqc report (`multiqc_report.html`) by right-clicking on the file and select 'Download'. Check out the hybrid-selection metrics. How did the hybrid capture go? Are most bases on-target? What kind of coverages can we expect in the target regions?

:::

::: {.callout-note}
You can find the documentation on the different metrics [here](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/picard-metric-definitions.html#HsMetrics). Note that the descriptions of the metrics are not always correct. The metrics with `ON_BAIT` contain information including duplicates, while `ON_TARGET` without duplicates. This has been an issue [since 2020](https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/issues/1494), and hasn't been worked on unfortunately.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer

We see that we have a fold enrichment of around 22 and about 45% usable bases on-target. About 90% were 'selected bases', which means bases aligning within 250 bp of the target region. We're looking at a de-duplicated coverage of 84x for the normal sample and 114.3x for the tumor sample. So, on average, we seem to have acceptable coverages for both samples.
