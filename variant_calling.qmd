## Exercises 

### First login

If you are participating in this course with a teacher, you have received a link and a password. Copy-paste the link (including the port, e.g.: `http://12.345.678.91:10002`) in your browser. This should result in the following page:

::: {.callout-note}
The link gives you access to a web version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). This is a powerful code editor that you can also use as a local application on your computer. 
::: 

Type in the password that was provided to you by the teacher. Now let's open the terminal. You can do that with ++ctrl+grave++. Or by clicking **Application menu** > **Terminal** > **New Terminal**:

For a.o. efficiency and reproducibility it makes sense to execute your commands from a script. With use of the 'new file' button:

### Setup

We will start the exercises with pre-aligned bam files. Create a directory `~/project/results/alignments` and download and extract the files in that folder:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/project/results/alignments
cd ~/project/results/alignments
wget linkk
gunzip bam_files.tar.gz
```

### Validating the bam files

First we use the information in the header to get information about the contents of the bam file and how it was generated. 

::: {.callout-important}
## Exercise

Check out the contents of the bam header with `samtools view -H`, and answer the following questions:

a. How is the bam file sorted?
b. Which chromosomes were used as reference?
c. How many read groups are in there, and what is the readgroup ID and what is the sample name? 
d. Which aligner was used? 
e. If there are duplicates in there, are they marked?

::: 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer

To get information on the bam header we run 

```sh
samtools view -H normal.rg.md.bam
```

Which returns:

```
@HD     VN:1.6  SO:coordinate
@SQ     SN:chr6 LN:170805979
@SQ     SN:chr17        LN:83257441
@RG     ID:HWI-ST466.C1TD1ACXX.normal   LB:normal       PL:ILLUMINA     SM:normal       PU:HWI-ST466.C1TD1ACXX
@PG     ID:bwa  PN:bwa  VN:0.7.17-r1188 CL:bwa mem /config/data/reference//ref_genome.fa /config/data/reads/normal_R1.fastq.gz /config/data/reads/normal_R2.fastq.gz
@PG     ID:samtools     PN:samtools     PP:bwa  VN:1.21 CL:samtools sort
@PG     ID:samtools.1   PN:samtools     PP:samtools     VN:1.21 CL:samtools view -bh
@PG     ID:MarkDuplicates       VN:Version:4.5.0.0      CL:MarkDuplicates --INPUT /config/data/alignments/normal.rg.bam --OUTPUT /config/data/alignments/normal.rg.md.bam
```

a. From the `@HD` tag, we can see that the bam file is sorted by coordinate.
b. We have two lines starting with `@SQ`, which gives us information about the reference used. The reference genome used contains chromosomes 6 and 17.
c. We have one line starting with `@RG`. Specifying there is a read group with ID `HWI-ST466.C1TD1ACXX.normal` and sample name `normal`. 
d. In order to know which programs were run to generate this bam file, we can use the `@PG` tags. Here, we see that the aligner used was `bwa mem` and duplicates were marked with `MarkDuplicates`. 

:::

Now we extract information from the alignments themselves. We first have a look at few alignments and then get a summary of the alignments with `samtools flagstat`. 

::: {.callout-important}
## Exercise

Check out the first few alignments with `samtools view`  and `head`. 

a. What is likely the read length used? 
b. Are the reads single-end or paired-end? 
c. Are the first reads tagged with the readgroup ID?

::: 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer

The command:

```sh
samtools view normal.rg.md.bam | head -3
```

Returns the first three alignments:

```

```

a. At the CIGAR strings we see `100M` and `2S98M`, meaning that the original read had 100 base pairs. So it's likely a read length of 100 bp has been used. 
b. This question might be a bit more challenging. In the 5th column we see an equal sign (`=`). This shows that the mate is mapped to same chromsome, so suggesting we are working with paired-end reads. In additon at the `@PG` header tag, we saw that `bwa mem` took two fastq files (`normal_R1.fastq.gz` and `normal_R2.fastq.gz`) as input.
c. Yes, the read group tag starts with `RG`, and is specified for all three reads.

::: {.callout-important}
## Exercise

Use `samtools flagstat` to summarize the alignments in both bam files. How many reads are in the bam files? And how many alignment are marked as duplicate? 

::: 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer

```sh 
samtools flagstat normal.rg.md.bam
```

returns:

```
12744793 + 0 in total (QC-passed reads + QC-failed reads)
12733034 + 0 primary
0 + 0 secondary
11759 + 0 supplementary
1397598 + 0 duplicates
1397598 + 0 primary duplicates
12671529 + 0 mapped (99.43% : N/A)
12659770 + 0 primary mapped (99.42% : N/A)
12733034 + 0 paired in sequencing
6366517 + 0 read1
6366517 + 0 read2
12515974 + 0 properly paired (98.30% : N/A)
12586532 + 0 with itself and mate mapped
73238 + 0 singletons (0.58% : N/A)
20414 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr
13194 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr (mapQ>=5)
```

Showing us that we have 12,744,793 reads and 1,397,598 alignments were marked as duplicate. If we do the same for the tumor bam file we see that it has 16,674,562 reads and 1,871,521 alignment marked as duplicate. 

:::

So, all looks good until now. We have many reads, high alignment rates, and the bam files seem to be ready for variant analysis, because they have read groups, duplicates are marked and they are sorted by coordinate. However, since we are working with whole exome sequencing (WES) data, we would like to know whether the reads align to the target regions and what kind of coverage we have. For this, we use `gatk CollectHsMetrics`. 

::: {.callout-important}
## Exercise

Create a script called `02_gatk_collecthsmetrics.sh` in `~/project/scripts` to run `gatk CollectHsMetrics` on the two bam files. Here's an example:

```sh
ALIGNDIR=~/project/results/alignments
REFDIR=~/project/data/reference
RESOURCEDIR=~/project/data/resources

for sample in tumor normal
do
    gatk CollectHsMetrics \
    -I "$ALIGNDIR"/"$sample".rg.md.bam \
    -O "$ALIGNDIR"/"$sample".rg.md.bam_hs_metrics.txt \
    -R "$REFDIR"/ref_genome.fa \
    --BAIT_INTERVALS "$REFDIR"/exome_regions.bed.interval_list \
    --TARGET_INTERVALS "$REFDIR"/exome_regions.bed.interval_list
done 
```
